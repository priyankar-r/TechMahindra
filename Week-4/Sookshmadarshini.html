                <h2>Review</h2>
                <p>Sookshmadarshini is a cleverly crafted thriller that turns a seemingly simple neighborhood story into an engaging mystery. Priyadarshini (Nazriya Nazim), 
                    a nosy microbiology graduate, shifts her microscope-like curiosity from microbes to her new neighbor, Manuel (Basil Joseph). 
                    Though Manuel appears kind and caring, there’s something subtly off about him—something only Priyadarshini picks up on.</p>
                <p> The narrative thrives on this suspicion, with Priyadarshini and her bumbling detective friends piecing together clues, 
                    often connected through WhatsApp. The screenplay, by Libin TB and Athul Ramachandran, keeps the audience guessing with 
                    smart diversions, unexpected humor, and a rewarding payoff that ties up even the smallest details. Basil Joseph steps 
                    out of his usual cheerful roles to explore a more mysterious side, while Nazriya’s vibrant comeback adds charm, though 
                    occasionally overplayed. Sookshmadarshini is an intriguing watch that blends suspense and humor, cementing Malayalam 
                    cinema’s reputation for fresh and quality storytelling.</p>

                        <p>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - In a typical neighborhood, Manuel returns with his mother to settle down. 
                            Priyadarshini, however, harbors her doubts about Manuel's intentions and suspects he has 
                            committed a crime. Along with her friends, she starts snooping around to uncover the truth. 
                            The real star of this movie is its screenplay, which keeps you glued to the screen. From the 
                            very first scene, Priyadarshini’s character is firmly established—nothing escapes her eagle 
                            eyes. While you may have plenty of questions throughout the narrative, hold your horses—everything 
                            will be answered. The film keeps your guessing game strong and delivers a suspenseful payoff that’s 
                            worth it. Nazriya Nazim makes a phenomenal comeback with this film. She shoulders the movie effortlessly, 
                            never going overboard, and balances her cuteness with maturity in just the right amounts.</p>
