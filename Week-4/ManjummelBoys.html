                <h2>Review</h2>
                <p>In Manjummel Boys, Chidambaram ensures that every detail serves a purpose, from a character’s loud screams to a seemingly casual 
                    tug-of-war both returning with satisfying payoffs. Building on his debut Jan-E-Man, where he skillfully balanced humor and morbidity,
                    Chidambaram takes on a new challenge here, keeping the audience engaged despite them knowing the outcome, as the film is inspired by 
                    real events.</p>
                <p>The story starts light-heartedly, with the gang crashing a wedding and clashing with rivals, before taking a sharp turn when one friend 
                    falls into a ravine. By then, the audience is familiar with the distinct traits of the eleven friends, making the emotional stakes stronger.
                    While the survival thriller recalls Bharathan’s Malootty, Manjummel Boys focuses more on friendship. A pivotal moment cuts from the crisis to
                    their childhood, showing how past bonds and instincts shape their present actions, adding emotional depth to the thriller.</p>

                            movie I couldn't chose which department should I praise more. Soubin shahir was perfect 
                            in the role of elder brother in a gang of youngsters.</p>
