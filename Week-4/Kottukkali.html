                <h2>Review</h2>
                <p>Kottukkaali is director PS Vinothraj’s powerful sophomore feature, surpassing his acclaimed debut Koozhangal. Like his first film, Kottukkaali 
                    explores family dynamics, patriarchy, and caste pride through a journey narrative. The film centers on Meena (a stellar Anna Ben), whose family 
                    believes she’s under the spell of her unseen lover from an oppressed caste. They force her into rituals to "cure" her, while Pandi (a fiery Soori), 
                    her betrothed, seethes with rage.</p>
                <p>Vinothraj’s masterful storytelling blends metaphors from nature — a red rooster mirroring Meena’s desire for freedom, and a stubborn bull blocking 
                    the path, eventually moved by kindness — to highlight themes of control, repression, and resistance. The film critiques generational patriarchy and 
                    caste arrogance, while also showing how women, though often silenced, can both challenge and uphold regressive beliefs. The film’s strength lies in 
                    its subtlety: minimal dialogue, naturalistic camerawork, and the absence of background music heighten the raw emotions. Anna Ben’s near-silent 
                    performance as Meena is deeply moving, while Soori delivers his career-best as the volatile Pandi. The supporting cast enriches the narrative, 
                    with moments of humor cleverly undercutting toxic masculinity.</p>

                        <p>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - "Kottukkaali" is an emotional, well-crafted Tamil drama that delves into the nuances of rural life, societal pressures, 
                            and personal struggles. The film stands out with its profound storytelling, rich characterization, and realistic depiction 
                            of life in rural Tamil Nadu. It explores themes of love, sacrifice, family, and societal expectations, making it relatable 
                            to the audience while also raising questions about human nature.</p>

                        <p>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - Film is culturally rooted with political relevance. In the course of the film, many things are touched through the dialogues such as caste dominance in villages, patriarchy, superstitions, and the power exercised by the groom's family over women. 
                            Main character is the roaster, which made me think, people are very similar both to the roaster and women. They nurture them, take good care, show affection when required, feed them, just to tie them and cut its neck off when needed. Just like they take advantage of women.
                            The narration, acting, and sound mixing are all in sync. The cinematography, in particular, is a phenomenal achievement, especially the shot that puts you in Soori's Acting.</p>

                        <p>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - Kottukaali throws light on the evils of patriarchy, superstitions and casteism in a wonderful and perfect mix of 
                            subtlety and realism by showcasing a slice in the life of a rural Tamil family.  Every frame in this 100 min film that start with 
                            the journey of the gang from their homes to the place of a seer to 'deal' with their family woman who's 'haunted with love' takes 
                            the audience along with them and conveys a ton of things./Spoilers ahead/ My favourites were the brilliant projection of ironies- 
                            the obvious internalized misogyny of women,  not recognizing a woman's basic human rights when she is 'let' to go to college, the 
                            guy who can beat up the weak to establish his bravery but holds back when a stronger opponent is in his way,  believing in seers' 
                            magics in a time and place where there's 24 hour electricity, well laid roads indicating progression/ development.</p>
