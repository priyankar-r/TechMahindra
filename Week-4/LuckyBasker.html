                <h2>Review</h2>
                <p>Maya Angelou once wrote, ‚ÄúWhen great trees fall in forests, small things recoil into silence‚Ä¶‚Äù Lucky Baskhar follows one such 
                    small thing‚Äîa simple bank cashier caught in the aftermath of the 90s banking scam. While films like Scam 1992 and The Big Bull
                    focused on the masterminds, director Venky Atluri shifts the spotlight to an ordinary man thrust into extraordinary circumstances.</p>
                <p>Baskhar, a kind-hearted man juggling small loans and everyday struggles, finds his life derailed by misfortunes. Determined to 
                    change his fate, he takes a risky leap, leading to a thrilling roller coaster ride. Venky Atluri crafts a gripping tale that blurs
                    the line between fiction and reality, making Lucky Baskhar an engaging watch till the very end.</p>

                        <p>‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è - Lucky Basker, directed by Venky Atluri, is an absolute masterpiece that redefines cinematic 
                            storytelling. Right from the opening scene, the film draws viewers into a nerve-wracking tale inspired by a 
                            character from Scam 1992, brilliantly expanding the character's journey into a gripping, full-length narrative 
                            that is both intense and thought-provoking.Atluri‚Äôs creativity shines throughout the film, building suspense with 
                            remarkable skill and presenting an original storyline that keeps audiences spellbound. The screenplay is masterfully 
                            crafted, each scene unfolding with seamless pacing that perfectly balances tension and emotion. Atluri‚Äôs unique approach 
                            to storytelling is immersive and engaging, making every twist feel both surprising and inevitable.</p>

                        <p>‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è - Must watch movie üçøüçøüçøüçøüçø, What makes Telugu cinema so enjoyable is how it gets the small moments right. 
                            These aren‚Äôt flashy or overly dramatic, they‚Äôre simple interactions and emotions that feel real. When a movie ties these 
                            together with good writing and execution, the result is impactful. That‚Äôs exactly what Lucky Bhaskar does and it does it 
                            really well.I‚Äôm still surprised Venky Atluri pulled this off. His earlier films didn‚Äôt set high expectations, but with 
                            Lucky Bhaskar, he shows that sticking to the basics and doing them well can elevate a film. And most of what I'm about 
                            to say is about sticking to the basics.Simply put, Lucky Bhaskar is a commercial film, but it stands apart. It avoids 
                            routine mass scenes designed to get ‚Äúcheer‚Äù moments. Instead, it builds emotional highs through clever writing.</p>

                        <p>‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è - Wow my god blown away thinking how did even this thought has stuck in directors mind . We hav seen 
                            many movies like how a poor guy becomes rich but this story has extracted from something u never even think of.

                            start believing it‚Äôs ur character on the screen & feel it‚Äôs ur story but soon realising how lucky is baskhar u 
                            realise its not ur story coz luck & we are birth enemies ( just kidding) coming bck dilqur Salman one man show 
                            wow wht an actor , direction , screenplay, cinematography, story credit goes to the director i became fan of his 
                            taking & execution from the 1st dialogue to the last He nailed it</p>
