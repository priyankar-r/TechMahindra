                <h2>Review</h2>
                <p>Premalu is a refreshing take on the classic rom-com formula, blending familiar tropes with Girish AD's signature 
                    storytelling charm. The film follows Sachin (Naslen K. Gafoor), a jobless engineer with low self-confidence, as 
                    he navigates love and life while falling for Reenu (Mamitha Baiju), a confident IT professional. While Sachin's 
                    journey echoes the struggles of protagonists from Girish‚Äôs earlier films Thanneer Mathan Dinangal and Super Sharanya, 
                    Premalu adds new layers by focusing on young adults transitioning into careers and independence. The film thrives on 
                    its witty screenplay, co-written by Girish AD and Kiran Josy, which ensures a lively pace throughout its 156-minute 
                    runtime. The chemistry between Sachin and Reenu is magnetic, and Sachin‚Äôs dynamic with his best friend Amal Davis 
                    (Sangeeth Prathap) brings in a steady stream of situational humor. The antagonist Aadhi (Shyam Mohan) injects 
                    comedic tension, following Girish‚Äôs tradition of lovable, over-the-top rivals.</p>
                <p>What makes Premalu stand out is its effortless setting‚Äîthere‚Äôs no forced attempt to be trendy or modern; everything 
                    naturally fits in place. The film‚Äôs humor, combined with Vishnu Vijay‚Äôs lively soundtrack, keeps the narrative 
                    energetic, even when the outcome seems predictable. While Thanneer Mathan Dinangal was a standout debut and Super 
                    Sharanya felt somewhat less impactful, Premalu marks Girish AD‚Äôs strongest outing yet. It‚Äôs a heartwarming, 
                    humorous story that captures the spirit of today‚Äôs youth while maintaining the timeless charm of a classic rom-com.</p>

                        <p>‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è - So a friend of mine made a random movie plan. I didn‚Äôt even know this movie‚Äôs name up until I 
                            sat in front of the big screen but let me tell you something, this movie was unexpectedly good and one of the 
                            best rom-coms i have watched in recent times. A beautiful and innocent love story that took me all the way back 
                            to my college days. The art of simplicity, which is something you don‚Äôt see in movies very often these days. 
                            That‚Äôs the brightest point of the plot.</p>
