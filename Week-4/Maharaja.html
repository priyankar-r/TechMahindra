                <h2>Review</h2>
                <p>Maharaja – A Dark, Twisted Tale of Ordinary Revenge Director Nithilan Saminathan once again delves into the unsettling 
                    underbelly of human nature in Maharaja, a dark thriller that thrives on its morbid sense of dread. Known for his 
                    meticulous writing and ability to turn everyday scenarios into chilling moments, Nithilan crafts a story where even 
                    the morally right find themselves corrupted in the face of humanity’s darker side. Maharaja doesn’t rely on shocking 
                    plot twists or elaborate set pieces but instead focuses on the mundane nature of evil. In one striking scene, robbers 
                    pause their violent spree to cook a hot meal—an unsettling contrast that underlines the film's dark humor. Nithilan's 
                    trademark of presenting evil in its most banal form is echoed in the film’s recurring motifs and idiosyncratic characters.</p>
                <p>Dark humor runs thick throughout the film. A gangster obsessed with the late actor Kunal Singh violently reprimands 
                    someone for not watching Punnagai Desam, and a thief named ‘Police’ only steals TVS 50s because he can’t ride geared 
                    bikes. These quirks, though bizarre, enrich the film’s world and highlight Nithilan’s unique storytelling voice.</p>
                <p>The story follows Maharaja (Vijay Sethupathi), a seemingly ordinary man who walks into a police station with a bizarre 
                        complaint—his iron trash can, named ‘Lakshmi,’ has been stolen. But as with all things in Maharaja, there’s more beneath 
                        the surface. The trash can holds significant emotional value, tied to a life-altering incident involving his daughter. 
                        Offering Rs. 7 lakhs for its return raises suspicions, leading Inspector Varadharajan (Natty) and his team to dig deeper, 
                        hoping to outwit Maharaja, only to find themselves entangled in something far more complex. The film cleverly jumps 
                        across timelines, revealing layers of its characters and plot. There’s Selvam (Anurag Kashyap), a cold-blooded criminal 
                        who casually chats about onions while women lie tied up beside him—an eerie nod to Nithilan’s debut film Kurangu Bommai. 
                        Objects become narrative anchors, with the seemingly insignificant trash can driving the entire plot, much like the 
                        monkey-faced bag in his first film.</p>
